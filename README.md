# NeuroAI - Digit Classifier App
This is a Streamlit app that implements a digit classifier using a neural network. Users can draw a digit on the canvas, and the trained neural network will predict the drawn digit.
### App Features

- **Draw and Predict:** Use the provided canvas to draw a digit of your choice. The trained neural network will predict the digit you drew.

- **Real-time Accuracy:** As the neural network trains, NeuroAI displays accuracy predictions, giving you insights into the model's progress.

- **User-Friendly Design:** NeuroAI's intuitive interface ensures a seamless and hassle-free experience for users, making it easy to interact with and get predictions.

- **Simple and Effective:** With a streamlined interface, the NeuroAI's purpose is clear: draw a digit, predict the result. No unnecessary complexities.
